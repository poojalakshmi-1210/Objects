 * 1) Create a second player.

 * 2) Log their details to the console.
 *
 * Notice how storing the items as a string
 * isn't a great approach. If the player
 * drops an item you'll have to manipulate
 * the string to remove the item.
 *
 * JavaScript has a way of storing lists
 * of items called an array. See Chapter 8.
